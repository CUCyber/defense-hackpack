\subsection{Logging}

There are a few commands that can be used to log terminal output that can be useful for generating logs and audit reports.
All three of these commands log all text entered into the terminal including ascii escape sequences so some clean up maybe necessary for readability.
\mbox{\lstinline|sed -r "s,\x1B\[[0-9;]*[a-zA-Z],,g"|} is a good start.


\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline|script [filename]| --- logs all commands to a file until ctrl-d is pressed
\item \lstinline|screen| --- use ctrl-a H to start and stop logging
\item \lstinline|tmux pipepane -o 'cat >>~/logfile.txt'| --- run this again to stop
\end{itemize}
