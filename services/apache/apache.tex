Apache is a one of the most popular web servers with a large variety of features.

\subsection{Installation}
There is a large variety of steps that are important for securing Apache.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Install Mod Security either from repos or from www.modsecurity.org
	\item Configure the Apache to use the Mod Security core rules from the repos or www.modsecurity.org
	\item Remove unnecessary options and text from Apache's httpd.conf file and /etc/httpd/conf.d (sometimes located at /etc/apache2/conf/extra)
	\item Remove all unnessisary modules entries from Apache's httpd.conf file
	\item Create an Apache user and group without a shell
	\item Configure Apache to run using this user and group
	\item Restrict access to the webserver via the Order allow,deny line in httpd.conf
	\item Prevent access to root file system
	\item Allow only read access to web directory /var/www/html
	\item Disable the following functionality if possible:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item ExecCGI --- Allow scripts to be run by apache from this directory.
			\item FollowSymLinks --- allow the server to follow symlinks
			\item SymLinksIfOwnerMatch --- has large performance costs.
			\item Includes --- permists the execution of server side includes
			\item IncludesNOEXEC --- same as above except prohibit executing scripts
			\item Indexes --- create an a directory listing in directories without an index.html
			\item AllowOverride --- allows overrides in \lstinline|.htaccess| files
			\item Multiviews --- allows for the same request to ask for multiple files.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Use RewriteEngine, RewriteCond, and RewriteRule to force HTTP 1.1
	\item Configure the web server to only server allowed file types.
	\item Configure to protect from DoS attacks
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Timeout --- set this to a low value like 10 seconds
			\item KeepAlive --- set this to on (unless RAM is a problem)
			\item KeepAliveTimeout --- set to 15
			\item AcceptFilter http data --- require content to open connection
			\item AcceptFilter https data --- require content to open connection
		\end{itemize}
	\item Configure to protect against Buffer Overflows
		\begin{itemize}
			\item LimitRequestBody 64000 --- Limit requests to 10k in size
			\item LimitRequestFeilds 32 --- Limit number of request fields
			\item LimitRequestFeildSize 8000 --- Limit size of request lines
			\item LimitRequestLine 4000 --- Maximum size of the request line
		\end{itemize}
	\item Use Mod\_SSL if possible (see openssl section for generating a sever certificate)
	\item Set ServerTokens to ProductOnly
	\item Use custom error pages via the ErrorDocument directive
	\item Remove default files and cgi-scripts
	\item Do not keep Apache Source after installation
	\item Ensure that web sever binaries are owned by root
	\item Allow only root to read the apache config or logs \lstinline|/usr/lib/apache/{conf,logs}|
	\item Move apache to a chroot if possible --- see below
	\item Use Mod\_Log\_Forensic
\end{itemize}
