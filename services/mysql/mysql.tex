\begin{itemize}
	\item Make sure it is only listening on localhost unless remote access is required by an inject (or the scoring engine) or you are running the webapps on a different server.
	\item Look for bind-address in the [mysqld] section and ensure it is set to 127.0.0.1 for local connections only or 0.0.0.0 for allowing remote connections
	\item Disable the LOCAL INFILE queries, which allows someone (red team) to upload files from their computers into your database (see here) by adding local-infile = 0 to the [mysqld] section of the conf file.
	\item Restart MySQL after making any conf changes.
\end{itemize}
