\section{Kerberos}\index{login!kerberos}

Kerberos is a remote login service that allows a set of Linux and Windows servers to share users and groups.
The current version of the protocol is version 5, and version 4 is deprecated and should not be used due to weak cryptography.

\subsection{Installation}

Kerberos can be configured to either authenticate against either Linux or a Windows Active Directory server:
Here is how to install and configure Kerberos to run on Linux.
\acmlisting[label=Kerberos Install,caption=Kerberos Install]{./users/kerberos/scripts/install.sh}

If you observe errors about pam winbind.conf missing create the following file:
\acmlisting[label=pam winbind.conf,caption=pam winbind.conf]{./users/kerberos/scripts/pam-winbind.conf}

After you have tested Kerberos, attempt to authenticate via PAM.
\acmlisting[label=pam-config,caption=pam-config]{./users/kerberos/scripts/pam-config.conf}

Kerberos itself uses a series of configuration files:
\acmlisting[label=krb5.conf,caption=krb5.conf]{./users/kerberos/scripts/krb5.conf}
